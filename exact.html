       <p>I was tasked with developing a business management dashboard for freelancers in the span of 3 weeks. In a group of three, I served as the lead visual designer. We sought to see where problems currently lie in managing life as a freelancer and find solutions.

       <h3>Research</h3>
       <br>
       <p>We started with downloading several business management dashboards + testing freelancer management websites to understand how their processes functioned. We also looked at general statistics and information on freelancers. Concurrently, interviews were conducted with 3 different freelancers trying to understand how they currently manage their jobs.</p>
       <p>We decided to harness the main frustrations of two of the individuals we interviewed and work on solving each one.</p>
   <h5>Problems (based primarily on interviews):</h5>

   <li>Interviewee 1 was a freelance musician frustrated by his busy schedule. He wished there were a way for him to find a little more enjoyment from his often hectic days.</li>
   <li>Interviewee 2 was a freelance personal trainer who had trouble getting his clients to pay him on time.</li>
   <br>

   <h5>Competitive Analysis Findings:</h5>
   <p>Based on interviewee 2, we looked closely at the varied frameworks for sending out late invoices / notices of non-payment. Many platforms did not account for this feature that we surveyed, apart from And.Co.</p>

          <h3>Solutions</h3>

         <p>For the initial interviewee, we implemented a feature that took a user’s weekly schedule and looked for gaps in time. This feature would make suggestions about events the user may consider going to have a bit of fun to balance out their stress.
         This would be done prior to an onboarding process that would take inventory of their interests to make personalized event selections.</p>

         <h1><i>Our way of using onboarding to find events for freelancer to potentially attend. </i></h1>
         <br><br>

         <p>For the second interviewee, we took the current framework of And.Co’s way of sending out late notices and invoices, and made it more streamlined. Currently, it requires a significant amount of clicks and various pages to go through this process. The method we developed allows for a minimal amount of clicks, and also the ability to test different types of notices without having to leave the current page.</p>

       <h3>Takeaways</h3>
       <br>
       <h5>Assessment of Problem Space:</h5>
<p>We essentially took a problem from each interviewee and ideated on what could be done about it. This approach was a bit shallow. In retrospect, I think we could have gone in depth on one of these problems instead and taken a more in depth look at that problem space to develop a more thorough solution.</p>

<h5>Understanding UI standards:</h5>
<p>Using figma’s live prototype testing features, I quickly realized that my early wireframes did not account for finger space well on certain devices. This project helped me take this more keenly into consideration.</p>
