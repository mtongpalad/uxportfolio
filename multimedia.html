       <p>I participated in a redesign of the CSU East Bay multimedia graduate program website over the course of a few weeks, in a team of 4. This was an opportunity to tackle some of the real-world problems users were having with the site, along with a means of figuring out if there were opportunities for new additions.</p>

       <h3>Process</h3>
       <br>
       <p><h6>Defining the Problem</h6><br>
During the process, I had the chance to interview a mix of different users who had all used the site at one point or another. This was comprised of a graduate student in their final year of the program, a student new to the program, and a student who planned to enter the program. This gave our team a great way of gaining perspective for use cases that touched on all possible points of contact in the site ecosystem.<br><br>
From the interviews, I learned that there were a lot of great things being done in the program that the interviewees felt were not reflected by the site. This is with regard to the works students have developed, campus events, and curriculum.<br><br>
From this, our team defined several key goals that we wanted the application to achieve: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><h6>Give a heightened focus to student work</h6></li>
The experience should highlight student works. Students want a clear picture of what it is they will be able to achieve by attending this program. Currently self-contained on the site expresses this aspect of the program, and the external offerings are dated.<br><br>
<li><h6>Provide better means of keeping tabs on campus events.</h6></li>
The program currently offers a robust guest speaker series, along with a regular series of Information Sessions for those interested in entering the program. These are both integral to prospective students moving toward applying to the school.<br><br>
<li><h6>Highlight educational outcomes</h6></li>
Apart from seeing the output of what students can achieve in project form, students will need clear articulation of what will attribute to this, by knowing what exactly they will be learning and in what order. The current paragraph clutter takes away from clarity in this area.<br><br>
</ul>

Many of these insights were extrapolated with the aid of different types of Journey Maps to find points within the experience that could be improved:

       <p>We noticed that these sites had clearly defined flows for users to access desired content, something less clear on our site’s current conflicting navigational elements.
       Using Jacob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics of Usability, we did a deep-dive into the CSU East Bay multimedia site and compiled a list of usability violations. The chart below captures the highest-priority issues encountered, the heuristic that was violated, and a metric of its severity to the user.</p>

       <p>The highest rated issues were problems that served to undermine the validity of the program. Confusion in site navigation is indicative of what navigating the actual student experience may be like, and so it was clear that this needed to be acted upon first and foremost. With all of this information, my team and I brainstormed and developed a clearly defined navigational experience for users. After wireframing, we came up with a solid prototype for the site. </p>

       <p>We created clearly defined tracks for what we found to be the most important avenues of site progression. This approach helped to circumvent any confusion experienced by the conflicting navigational elements present in the initial design.
On top of this, we acted on some of the initial findings from the user interviews and competitive analysis. </p>

       <h3>Takeaways</h3>
       <br>
       From this experience, I learned some important lessons that I can apply to future projects.
 <br><br>
<h6>Conflict</h6>
There were times during this project where it was difficult to a consensus on a course of action between multiple ideas, but ultimately had to agree on something in order to conform to the allotted time frame. Ultimately a business will need to meet deadlines so this was an important thing to develop, to swallow pride even if my desired trajectory wasn’t chosen.<br><br>
<h6>Importance of Competetive Analysis</h6>
From this process I realized that having a grasp on the current standards of how to design something is really important for subsequently being able to detract from that and innovate. <br><br>
<h6>If I had more time...</h6>
I would ideate about other ways in which we could solve other issues addressed in user interviews. This is related to curriculum and relaying some of its more nuanced attributes clearly.
